        AN-SOF ANTENNA SIMULATOR
-------------------------------------------------

3-elements Yagi-Uda antenna.

Simulation of a Yagi antenna that consists of three linear wires. A directional radiation pattern is obtained as can be expected. The current distribution on the array can be plotted as a color map in order to compare the current intensities between the elements of the array.
